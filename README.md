# UCM-CSE-031
Repository containing CSE031: Computer Organization Labs &amp; Projects
This was a computer science course taken to learn computer organization. This provided us with new skills on how to understand
a computer and its inner workings. Throughout the class we used C code and MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System), and 
created two projects, one for each respective language. 

Within each lab folder there will be a description outlining the purpose of the lab, same goes for the project folders.
